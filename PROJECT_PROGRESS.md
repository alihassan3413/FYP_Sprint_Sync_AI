# SprintSync — Project Progress

Living tracker for FR implementation status, decisions, and what to build next.
Source of truth for FR wording: `SprintSync FYP1 Report.docx` (FR01–FR35).

## Current FR status

| Status | Count | FRs |
|---|---|---|
| Complete | 8 | FR01, FR14, FR15, FR16, FR17, FR24, FR29, FR32 |
| Partial | 9 | FR02, FR03, FR04, FR27, FR30, FR31, FR33, FR34, FR35 |
| Not started | 18 | FR05–FR13, FR18–FR23, FR25, FR26, FR28 |

Strict completion: **8 / 35 (22.9%)**. Weighted (Complete=1, Partial=0.5): **35.7%**.

The codebase is a real multi-tenant workspace product now: auth, workspaces,
invitations, custom roles, team management, projects, and a task/Kanban
board are all built and tested. Still missing: the entire meetings + AI
transcription/summary pipeline (FR05–FR13), archive/search (FR18–FR19),
analytics (FR20), in-app/email notifications (FR21–FR23), notification
preferences (FR25), profile pictures (FR26), and audit log (FR28).

## Completed work log

### 1. FR01–FR35 implementation audit
Full codebase audit against the FYP1 report, file-by-file evidence, verified
with `route:list`, the test suite, Pint, ESLint, and a production build.
Found the app was a solid workspace/team/roles foundation with none of the
report's meeting/AI/task/notification domain built yet.

### 2. Fixed: invitations silently failing on the Team page
`useCurrentWorkspace.ts`'s `workspaceRoute()` fell back to `route('login')`
whenever the globally-"current" workspace didn't match the workspace a page
was actually scoped to. The invite form POSTed to `/login`, which — for an
authenticated user — bounced straight to the dashboard with no error.
Fixed by letting callers pass an explicit `workspace` param that takes
priority, and having `workspace/invitations/Create.vue` use its own
controller-provided `workspace` prop instead of global state.

### 3. FR32 — Projects module (Create/list/view/edit/delete)
Full workspace-scoped Projects module: migration, model, factory, policy
(Owner/Admin manage, any member views), Data DTOs, requests, actions,
controller, routes under `TenantRoute`, full Vue CRUD UI, 18 feature tests.
`Workspace::projects()` relation added — required for Laravel's automatic
scoped route-model-binding on `{workspace}/projects/{project}`.

### 4. Fixed: Team-page "Change role" / "Remove member" silently failing
Same bug class as #2, different shape: `ChangeMemberRoleModal.vue` and
`RemoveMemberDialog.vue` called `workspaceRoute(name, member.id)` — a bare
number instead of a params object. `workspaceRoute()` spreads its second
argument (`{...params, workspace}`); spreading a number produces `{}`, so
the `user` route parameter silently vanished. Fixed by passing
`{ user: member.id }`, matching the actual route signature
(`{user}` in `app/Modules/Teams/Routes/web.php`, bound to `User $user`).

### 5. FR14–FR17 — Project Tasks & Kanban board
New `Tasks` module, scoped three levels deep:
`{workspace}/projects/{project}/tasks/{task}`. Migration, model
(`App\TaskStatus` enum: `todo` / `in_progress` / `done`), factory, policy,
Data DTOs, requests, actions, controller, routes, full Vue Kanban UI
(3 columns, per-card status control, create/edit/delete modals, assignee
picker), 20 feature tests. `Project::tasks()` relation added for the same
scoped-binding reason as #3. `ProjectController::show` now also returns
`tasks`, `members`, and `canManageTasks` so the board renders on the
existing project page (no separate board route).

### 6. Projects/Tasks UX redesign — Kanban-first project workspace
Reworked the project page around the board instead of a metadata card, and
replaced the per-card status buttons with real drag-and-drop.

- **Projects index**: rows were already clickable (`AppDataTable`'s
  `clickable-rows`); removed "View" from `ProjectActionsMenu` (Edit/Delete
  only, menu hidden entirely for non-managers instead of showing an empty
  dropdown).
- **Project show page redesign**: compact header (title + truncated
  description via `AppPageHeader`, no more full-width Overview card),
  workspace-style tabs — **Board** (default), **Meetings** (placeholder),
  **Activity** (placeholder), **Settings** (project details + danger zone,
  moved out of the header). Page container no longer caps width, so the
  board fills the available space.
- **Drag-and-drop Kanban**: native HTML5 DnD (`draggable`, `dragstart`,
  `dragover.prevent`, `drop`) — no library added. `KanbanBoard.vue` keeps an
  independent local copy of `tasks` (`localTasks`, deep-copied per element)
  so a drop moves the card instantly; the same
  `workspace.projects.tasks.update-status` endpoint is called via
  `router.patch`, and `onError` reverts the card's status and fires a toast
  through the existing `useNotificationStore()`. A per-card `pending` state
  disables re-dragging and dims the card while its request is in flight;
  a brief `hasError` ring flashes red on failure. Only draggable if the
  viewer could already change that task's status (Owner/Admin, or the
  assignee) — same authorization the old segmented control used, so no
  backend rule changed.
- **Task cards**: dropped the 3-button status switcher entirely; clicking a
  card opens `EditTaskModal`. That modal now takes a `canManage` prop — full
  edit form for Owner/Admin, a read-only "Task details" view for everyone
  else (uses `TaskPolicy::view`, which already permitted this — no policy
  change, just the first UI that exposes it).
- **New `Tabs` UI primitive** (`resources/js/components/ui/tabs/`) built on
  `reka-ui`'s `TabsRoot/TabsList/TabsTrigger/TabsContent` — already a
  dependency (same library the existing `Dialog`/`Checkbox`/`Separator`
  wrappers use) — so no package was added for the tabs either.

## Key architectural decisions

- **Tasks is its own module**, not nested inside Projects — mirrors how
  `Teams` is already a separate module from `Workspace` despite the
  conceptual overlap. Modules are organized by feature area, not raw
  parent/child DB relationships.
- **`App\TaskStatus`** lives at the top level (`app/TaskStatus.php`), not
  inside a module — mirrors `App\UserRole`'s placement. Cross-cutting small
  enums live outside `app/Modules` in this codebase.
- **Two distinct task-authorization abilities**: `update` (full edit —
  Owner/Admin only) vs. `updateStatus` (the assignee, or Owner/Admin). This
  is what lets a Member drag/change status on their own card without
  granting them edit/delete rights — matches "Members can view/update
  permitted tasks; Owner/Admin can manage all tasks."
- **Drag-and-drop uses the native HTML5 DnD API, not a library.** Checked
  `package.json`/`node_modules` first — nothing suitable was already
  installed (`@vueuse/core` has no `useSortable`; that's a separate,
  unpackaged `@vueuse/integrations` addon). Native DnD needed zero new
  dependencies, matching `CLAUDE.md`'s "don't change dependencies without
  approval." Trade-off: it's mouse-primary — no keyboard or reliable touch
  fallback exists now that the segmented control is gone (see Known gaps).
- **The Kanban board's data rides on `ProjectController::show`**, not a
  separate Tasks index route — matches this app's existing convention that
  a page's own controller aggregates whatever it needs to render
  (`DashboardController` does the same across Workspace/Invitations).
  Verified via Laravel's `ImplicitRouteBinding` source that 3-level scoped
  bindings (`workspace → project → task`) enforce pairwise parent scoping
  correctly, so a task 404s unless it belongs to both the project and
  workspace in the URL.
- **`workspaceRoute()` bugs (#2 and #4) share one root cause**: silently
  trusting global "current workspace" state instead of the page's own
  scoped params. Every new page/component built since has passed explicit
  `{ paramName: id }` objects rather than relying on that fallback.

## Test results

The Projects/Tasks UX redesign (#6) is frontend-only — no PHP changed, so
the backend suite is an unaffected-regression check, not new coverage:

```
php artisan test --compact
Tests:    128 passed (384 assertions)

vendor/bin/pint --format agent
→ passed

npm run lint:check
→ 0 errors

npm run build
✓ built in 2.33s (3130 modules, no errors)
```

Covers: auth, email verification, password reset/update, profile update,
dashboard, workspace tenant isolation, workspace CRUD, workspace roles,
workspace invitations, team member management, AI assistant endpoints,
module boundaries, Projects (18 tests), Tasks (20 tests).

No JS test runner exists in this project (`package.json` only has
build/lint/format scripts) — the drag-and-drop interaction itself has no
automated test; correctness was verified by ESLint + a successful
production build (catches type/template errors) plus manual code review,
not by exercising it in a browser.

## Known gaps worth flagging

- `resources/js/pages/workspace/settings/RoleManagement.vue` calls
  `workspaceRoute('workspace.roles.update', selectedRoleId)` with a bare
  ID — the same bug class as fixes #2/#4, not yet fixed (out of scope for
  the tasks that touched it).
- **Drag-and-drop has no keyboard or touch fallback.** The per-card status
  buttons were removed as requested; status can now only change by mouse
  drag or (for Owner/Admin) isn't exposed any other way either. Worth a
  follow-up (e.g. a status control inside the read-only/edit task modal)
  if touch/keyboard users are a real constituency for this app.
- FR14-04 ("default to my tasks, with an option to view all") is not
  implemented — the board always shows every task in the project.
- FR16-02 ("status changes reflect immediately across all active users'
  dashboards") has no live push — other open browser tabs only see a
  status change after their own next page load. Would need broadcasting
  (Echo/Pusher/Reverb), which hasn't been introduced.
- FR15-01 (auto-create tasks from a distributed meeting summary) is
  intentionally not built — it depends on the entire meetings/AI-summary
  pipeline (FR05–FR13), which doesn't exist yet.
- The **Meetings** and **Activity** tabs on the project page are visual
  placeholders only (`AppEmptyState`, no route/data behind them) — exactly
  as scoped ("Do not build Meetings, Activity functionality... yet").

## Next recommended task

**FR05 — Schedule Meeting**, as the first slice of the meetings domain
(FR05–FR13). It's the largest remaining block of the spec and everything
after it (transcription, AI summaries, review/approve, archive, and
FR15-01's auto-task-creation) depends on meetings existing first. Model:
title, date/time, duration, agenda, participants (workspace members),
generated join link; scoped the same way as Projects/Tasks
(`{workspace}/meetings/{meeting}`); Owner/Admin (or whoever holds
`members.invite`-equivalent permission) schedules, all workspace members
can view. Suggested build order after that: FR06 (view details) → FR07
(join) → FR08 (edit) → FR09 (cancel) → FR23 email triggers, before
attempting FR10–FR13 (transcription/AI summary), which is the hardest,
most novel piece and should come last once real meeting data exists to
work against.

The project page's **Meetings** tab is already scaffolded as a placeholder
(`resources/js/pages/projects/show.vue`) — FR05 can replace that
`AppEmptyState` with a real meetings list/create flow without any further
page-layout work, following the same tabs-content pattern the Board tab
already establishes.
